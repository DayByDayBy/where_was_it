# Gemini Recovery Document

## Project Goal
React Native app for quick transport delay reporting to customer service ("Where Was It").

## Last Completed Action
Attempted to start the Expo app, but encountered a Watchman "Operation not permitted" error.

## Current Problem
The project folder is located in a protected directory, preventing Watchman from properly monitoring files. This causes the Expo development server to fail to start.

## Required Manual Action (User)
1.  **Move the `lateAgain` project folder** from its current location (`/Users/gboa/Documents/lateAgain`) to a less restricted directory (e.g., directly under your home directory, like `/Users/gboa/lateAgain`).
2.  **Inform Gemini of the new absolute path** to the `lateAgain` project folder.

## Next Action (Gemini)
Once the user provides the new absolute path, Gemini will:
1.  Update its internal working directory to the new path.
2.  Attempt to start the Expo app again from the new location to verify the project setup (Step 1: Setup).
